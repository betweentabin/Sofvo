# Anima Project

Welcome! This project has been automatically generated by [Anima](https://animaapp.com/).

## Domain & URLs (Production)

- Current preview (temporary): https://sofvo.vercel.app
- Production will NOT use Vercel (backend + DB on Railway only). When switching domains, update:
  - backend/.env: set `FRONTEND_URL` to your production web/app origin(s)
  - .env / .env.production: set `VITE_NODE_API_URL` and `VITE_MOBILE_API_URL` to `https://<your-backend>.up.railway.app/api`
  - index.html: CSP meta `connect-src` must include your Railway API origin (e.g., `https://<your-backend>.up.railway.app`)
  - If you keep Vercel for previews only, set `RAILWAY_API_ORIGIN` there; otherwise this proxy is not required

## Getting started

> **Prerequisites:**
> The following steps require [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) to be installed on your system, so please
> install it beforehand if you haven't already.

To get started with your project, you'll first need to install the dependencies with:

```
npm install
```

Then, you'll be able to run a development version of the project with:

```
npm run dev
```

After a few seconds, your project should be accessible at the address
[http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/)


If you are satisfied with the result, you can finally build the project for release with:

```
npm run build
```

## Storybook

After installing, you can view your storybook by running:

```
npm run storybook
```

After a few seconds, your storybook should be accessible at the address
[http://localhost:6006/](http://localhost:6006/)

You can build your storybook for release with:

```
npm run build-storybook
```

## Mobile App Release (Capacitor)

- Package as iOS/Android via Capacitor.
- Steps:
  - Set `VITE_MOBILE_API_URL` (.env/.env.production) to the production API base
  - Ensure backend CORS (`FRONTEND_URL`) allows `capacitor://localhost`, `ionic://localhost`
  - Update CSP in `index.html` (`connect-src`) for production API
  - Build + sync: `npm run build:capacitor` then `npx cap sync`
  - Open platforms: `npx cap open ios` / `npx cap open android`
